How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    A: it helped me to identify the differences and spot them efficiently 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    A: by having the whole history you can have various verions and reflect on the changes you have made before.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    i have not yet observed the doc version of google hence i do not know how it works

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because it is tedious to save each file git allows saving everything on one go. but i have no clue on how it works in google docs

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    i have yet to use those commands

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    i think version control utilises non-distructive file altering mechanish, hence you feel far more confident to make changes in the file. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    firstly learn and see how to use git and utilise the sources in git for my upcomming projects.
